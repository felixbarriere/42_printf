# printf_42

This project is pretty straight forward. You will recode printf. You will mainly learn how to use variadic arguments.

This project consists of coding a library that contains a simplified version (more
information below) of the printf function.

## 🛠️ Usage
### Requirements
The function is written in C language and thus needs the gcc compiler and some standard C libraries to run.

### Instructions
1. Compiling the library

To compile, go to the src directory and run:

> $ make
 
2. Using it in your code

To use the library functions in your code, simply include its header:

> #include "ft_printf.h"
## 📋 Testing
You can use this third party tester to fully test the project:

> - [Tripouille/printfTester](https://github.com/Tripouille/printfTester)

or go in the ft_printf.c file and uncomment the main function at the bottom
